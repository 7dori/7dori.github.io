    <h1>Woah! What the heck are tags? </h1>
    <p>
        There are seemingly an endless amount of tags that are used in code. We'll be looking at some of the common tags in HTML and their similarities/differences with/from one another. 
        <br>
        The Opening tag is indicated by the brackets '<', followed by the tag name i.e. "body", and a closing bracket '>'. The opening tag of a body section would look like this < body >. The Closing tag follows a similar format with an additional '/' before the tag name i.e '</ body >'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking at 'Hello World' showed us a few tags. We'll go in order. 

        First we saw the <!DOCTYPE> tag. We always start off an HTML document with the doctype followed by 'html'. So <! Doctype html >
    </p>
    <p>
        The Document itself begins with < html> and closes with the closing tag < /html >
    </p>
    <p>
        The visible part of the HTML Doc goes between the body tags which are nested within the html tags.
    </p>
    <p>
        The nesting format is important for organizational purposes. It's important to start with good habits from the beginning!
    </p>
    <p>
        The next couple of tags that are important are 'head' and 'title'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some other tags that are important are 'p' for paragraph, 'div' for Content Division or Section, 'img' which doesn't use a closing tag, and 'a' for Anchor links which take you to a certain link url or anchor on a page (more on that later). We also have a series of Heading tags 'h1 - h6'. These can be used to indicate various heading sizes.
